#### What is a front end developer?


---

#### What is a front end developer?
**Front-end web development**, also known as **client-side** development is the practice of producing **HTML, CSS and JavaScript** for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website **change constantly** and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.


--- 

#### What is a front end developer?

The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the **users** open up the site they see the information in a format that is **easy to read and relevant**. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large **variety of devices** with varying **screen sizes** and **resolutions** thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in **different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device)**, which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.(<a href="https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/what-is-a-FD.html">Front end masters</a>)
