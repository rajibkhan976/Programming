### 8. Backend APIs
#### Microservices

#### A Brief History of APIs and Service composition

---

#### Purpose and Scope

Why are we listening to this, and what is the takeaway:
* It’s required by the curriculum
* Understand that software evolves over time and due to business needs
* Understand that technology is created to solve specific problems
* Understand what kind of problems current technologies address

* Keep Calm and Carry on! One foot in front of the other!

#### Static HTML

Simple request response

* Just GET.
* “Hello World”.
* Can still run javascript.

#### Dynamic HTML with Database

HTML contents rendered data in database

* HTML rendered based on database contents.
* Lack of separation made a mess:.
  * All code runs in the browser.
  * Code could only be obfuscated, no secrets!
  * No separation of Business logic and view.
  * SQL injection.

#### Separation of Concerns

Model View Controller

* Simple pattern separating concerns:.
* Model:.
  * Responsible for managing the data of the application.. 
  * It receives user input from the controller..
* View:.
  * Presentation of the model in a particular format..			
* Controller:.
  * Responds to the user input. 
  * Performs interactions on the data model objects..

#### Application programming interface (API)

The classic frontend backend solution.

* More Separation of concerns.
  * Backend focuses on data.
  * Frontend on presentation.
  * Client (browser) handles  both.

* Replace the view with ex. REST.
  * Representational State Transfer (REST):.
  * HTTP protocol same as frontend.
  * Body in JSON, XML or other.
  * HTTP methods to view and change data.
  * Resources identified with URIs.

---

#### Application programming interface (API)

* APIs can have multiple consumers.
  * Admin View.
  * User View.
  * System-to-system communication.

#### It’s not Just About Users

How do we spread responsibility across a large monolithic (single piece) application?

* A lot of time wasted on synchronization.
  * Planning takes forever.
  * Which team has mandate to do what.
  * Functional responsibility (database, protocol) etc does not map to user features..

---

#### It’s not Just About Users

* Libraries for Commonly used Code.
  * Same lib used in different ways (inflexible).
  * Creates coupling between unrelated features.
* Conway’s Law.
  * Need to communicate to write software.
  * Communication boundaries between teams.
  * Software architecture should reflect Organizational Structure.

#### Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)

Many small services, one Team Per Service

* Small focused services.
* Team responsible for entire service.
  * Frontend and Backend (API).
  * Provides support to other teams.
  * Also responsible for deployment and operations of the service (DevOps).

* Great for Large organisations.
  * Pioneered at Amazon.
  * 1 (American sized) pizza team.

* Great for Large organisations.
  * You’re not amazon - Can you afford team per service?.

#### Microservices and Service Discovery

Provide business needs (bounded domains) using a collection of small services with a clear responsibility.

* API gateway or Load Balancer in front.
  * Presents a single solution hiding services.
  * Host or Path mapping to services (/email).
  * May provides authentication and authorization to services.
* Enables horizontal scaling.
  * Add additional service instances.
  * Add additional compute nodes.
  * Services register with service discovery so other services can find them.
* Looks like “a single” API from the gateway.

#### Purpose and Scope

Software is about managing complexity:
* All software starts out simple
* Software always grows to handle more complexity
* As software grows, complexity needs to be broken into manageable sizes
* “Technical Debt” is when technology isn’t helping us manage complexity
* Business, users, developers and operations all have needs to address
* Standing on the shoulder of giants, it may feel like a lot to take in - but
* You don’t need to understand all at once, just one service at a time...
