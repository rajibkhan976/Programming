#### Images

* Images can be used to lift your site, but bad usage might make it look worse.
* When using images in your webpages always consider why you use your images.
* Also where to get and store photos/images? Are they stored on a server you own, in the cloud or elsewhere?



---

#### Formats

* JPEG, GIF, PNG & SVG are image formats often used on the web. 
* Setting the size of images can be done using different units (px, pt, em, cm, mm).



---

#### Image sizes

* If the image is to small i can be stretched or pixelated.
* If the image is to big it takes a long time to load.
* Test examples (chapter 5).



---

####  HTML Image

* ```<img>``` is the element for images.
* The src attribute tells the browser where to find the image.
* The alt attribute describes the image if you can't see it.
* Screen readers which reads the webpage out loud will read the alt text.
* The alt text will also be displayed if the image failed loading.

```HTML
<!-- using the img tag -->
<img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="Quokka">
```

####  HTML Image example

```HTML
<img
  title="Squirrel"
  width="400"
  height="300"
  src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Squirrel_posing.jpg"
  alt="Squirrel"
>
```

---

#### Placing an image

* The image will behave differently depending on where you place it (inside different elements).
* It can be controlled using the align attribute.
* See examples (chapter 5)
