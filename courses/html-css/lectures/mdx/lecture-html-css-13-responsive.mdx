### 13.HTML & CSS
#### Responsive web design


---

#### What is a responsive web design?

* The layout changes depending on the screensize and resolution that the user has
* Responsive web design makes your web page look good on all devices.
* Desktop, mobile, tablet, watches
* Screen sizes and resolutions differ on each device/screen



---

<img style="margin-top: 0px;" src={img0} alt="different screens"/>
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_intro.asp">More examples</a>


---

#### Different techniques

* Fluid grids, columns and sections has relative values (%)
* Flexbox & CSS grid
* CSS3 Media queries
* (JavaScript solutions)



---

#### Viewport

* The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.
* The viewport will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.
* Back in the days it was common to just scale down the site from desktop to mobile
* <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp">W3schools example</a>



---

####  Viewport  meta tag
* The browser will (probably) render the width of the page at the width of its own screen.
* If that screen is 480px wide, the browser window will be 480px wide, rather than way zoomed out and showing 960px.
* [CSS-Tricks meta tag description](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/html/responsive-meta-tag/)

```HTML
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```



---

#### Grid view

* A grid-view, means that the page is divided into columns
* A responsive grid-view often has 12 columns, and has a total width of 100%, and will shrink and expand as you resize the browser window.

#### 12 column grid

<img src={img1} alt="gid"/>


---

####  Responsive Grid

```CSS
  .col-1 {width: 8.33%;}
  .col-2 {width: 16.66%;}
  .col-3 {width: 25%;}
  .col-4 {width: 33.33%;}
  .col-5 {width: 41.66%;}
  .col-6 {width: 50%;}
  .col-7 {width: 58.33%;}
  .col-8 {width: 66.66%;}
  .col-9 {width: 75%;}
  .col-10 {width: 83.33%;}
  .col-11 {width: 91.66%;}
  .col-12 {width: 100%;}
```

---


####  Responsive Grid

* The grid should be 12
* So the columns should add up to 12 always

```HTML
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-3">...</div> <!-- 25% -->
  <div class="col-9">...</div> <!-- 75% -->
</div>
```
[w3schools example](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=tryresponsive_cols)



---



#### Media Queries
* A CSS technique introduced in CSS3.
* It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.

```CSS
  @media not|only mediatype and (mediafeature and|or|not mediafeature) {
    /*CSS-Code;*/
  }

  /* If the browser window is 480px or smaller, the background color will be green: */
  @media only screen and (max-width: 480px) {
    body {
      background-color: green;
    }
  }
```



---

#### Linking different stylesheets depending on screen size

```HTML
  <!-- If the screen is 900px or wider widescreen.css will be loaded -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width: 900px)" href="widescreen.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (max-width: 600px)" href="smallscreen.css">
```
        


---


#### @media Rule

Can be used to check:

* width and height of the viewport (min/max).
* width and height of the device (min/max).
* orientation (landscape/portrait).
* resolution.

---

#### Orientation: Portrait / Landscape

* Change layout of a page depending on the orientation of the browser.

```CSS
  @media only screen and (orientation: landscape) {
    body {
      background-color: lightblue;
    }
  }
```
        


---

#### Media rules needs to be placed beneath the style they effect.


---
      

#### Mobile first

* Mobile First means designing for mobile before designing for desktop or any other device.
* Instead of changing styles when the width gets smaller, we should change the design when the width gets larger.



---

#### Breakpoints

* A breakpoint is where certain parts of the design will behave differently on each side of the breakpoint.

```CSS
/* For mobile phones: */
[class*="col-"] {
  width: 100%;
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  /* For desktop: */
  .col-1 {width: 25%;}
  .col-2 {width: 50%;}
  .col-3 {width: 75%;}
  .col-4 {width: 100%;}
}
/* Mobile first, since we are changing styles when the width gets larger than 768px. */
```

#### Typical Device Breakpoints

* Hard to create an exact breakpoint for each device, since there are tons of screens and devices with different widths and heights
* Five groups, to make it easier

```CSS
  /* Extra small devices (phones, 600px and down) */
  @media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {...}

  /* Small devices (portrait tablets and large phones, 600px and up) */
  @media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {...}

  /* Medium devices (landscape tablets, 768px and up) */
  @media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {...}

  /* Large devices (laptops/desktops, 992px and up) */
  @media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {...}

  /* Extra large devices (large laptops and desktops, 1200px and up) */
  @media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) {...}
```

#### Multiple breakpoints
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=tryresponsive_col-s">Example</a>


---

#### It is not uncommon to build two versions of the entire site/app

* Mobile - https://mobil.blocket.se/
* Desktop - https://www.blocket.se/



---

#### Images

```CSS
img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}

img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```
